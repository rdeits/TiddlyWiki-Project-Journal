# TiddlyWiki Poject Journal

This is a set of modifications and plugins to [MPTW](http://mptw.tiddlyspot.com/), a [TiddlyWiki](http://www.tiddlywiki.com/)-based system for organizing information. I use it as a template for my personal project tracking.

# Features
* `{{thumb{}}}`, `{{stretch{}}}`, and `{{shrink{}}}` image resizing tags.

* Drag a file onto the TiddlyWiki to create a Tiddler with a relative
  link, and a preview of image content.

* "New Journal" macro always tags the new Tiddler with "Journal" so that it shows up on the front page

* Sensible year-month-date scheme so that alphabetical sort also sorts by date
